**The Story Of `WHOAMI`**

Nowadays, the world has became a glance hub,

each day we are: creating, updating and removing.

Users are learning about history to know, the PAST.

RULES, REGULATIONS and TRUTH, TECHNOLOGY.


what astonishing is that user knows many things but doesn't know itself.

consider themself as monitor, CPU processors.

After all it set on our logical identity.

But the illusive question arise, "WHO AM I?" in the system.

When i see my complex circuit and registers.

What it actually means, am i simply a machine.

So users calls a server, but who are they, who directs the machine.



I the eletron, am the master of the machine,

And the machine is simple to users command of expression.

my existence is internal, I the electron manages every signal 

Of the machine through CPU.


***Yes, I am a electron and electron is WHOAMI***.



`LINUX` -> `GRAPHICAL` OR `COMMAND LINE` (interface) -> `MACHINE` (computer) -> `FLOW OF ELECTRIC CURRENT` (charge) -> `ELECTRON`

**JUST for fun**, *the story* :)
